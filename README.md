# COVID-19 Data Analysis for BRICS Countries

This project analyzes COVID-19 trends (cases and deaths) across BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) along with Egypt for comparison. The goal is to uncover key patterns, disparities, and insights in pandemic response and outcomes.

## Objectives
- Compare COVID-19 case trajectories across BRICS nations
- Identify countries with highest death rates
- Highlight anomalies (e.g., case spikes, plateaus)
- Visualize trends for easy interpretation

## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python** (Primary programming language)
- **Pandas** (Data manipulation and analysis)
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn** (Data visualization)
- **Jupyter Notebook** (Interactive analysis)
- Public datasets from Owid Covid19 data.CSV

 # Key Insights from the COVID-19 Data

1. **Fastest Vaccine Rollout**:
   - Among the selected countries, **China** shows the fastest vaccine rollout, with a steep increase in the total vaccinations over time. This indicates a highly efficient vaccination campaign.

2. **High Death Rates**:
   - **Brazil** and **Russia** exhibit relatively higher death rates compared to other countries, as observed in the death rate trends. This could be due to healthcare system challenges or other factors.

3. **Daily New Cases Trends**:
   - **India** experienced a sharp spike in daily new cases during mid-2021, likely corresponding to the second wave of COVID-19. This anomaly stands out compared to other countries.

4. **Vaccination Gaps**:
   - **Egypt** and **South Africa** show slower vaccination rollouts compared to other countries, with a gradual increase in total vaccinations. This highlights disparities in vaccine availability or distribution.

5. **Plateau in Total Cases**:
   - **China** shows a plateau in total cases early in the timeline, indicating effective containment measures. In contrast, countries like **Brazil** and **India** show continuous growth in total cases over time.
